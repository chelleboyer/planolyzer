# Welcome to Planolyzer! 🏪

This application helps you verify if uploaded images match your reference planogram. Simply upload an image, and the system will analyze its similarity to the reference planogram.

## How to Use

1. Upload an image of your shelf or display
2. The system will automatically compare it with the reference planogram
3. You'll receive a similarity score and whether the image is accepted or rejected

## Tips for Best Results

- Ensure good lighting in your photos
- Capture the entire shelf/display area
- Minimize shadows and glare
- Keep the camera steady and level

## Understanding the Results

- **Similarity Score**: Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect match
- **Difference Percentage**: Shows how much the image differs from the reference
- **Acceptance**: Images with similarity score > 0.7 are considered matches
